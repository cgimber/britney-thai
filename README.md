# britney-thai
personal site for britney thai

## Getting Started :memo:

Install [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with the following command: 
```
sudo gem install sass
```
Then cd into the site directory and run the following command:
```
sass --watch css/main.scss:css/main.css
```
As long as you keep this terminal window open, sass will keep main.css up-to-date in the background

Make your changes to main.scss :)
